# Snowflake Integration in Accessibilify
## ADA Compliance Data Warehouse Architecture

---

## üèóÔ∏è What We Store in Snowflake

### **1. Analysis Records** (`ANALYSES` table)
- **Video Metadata**: Video ID, title, duration, timestamp
- **Compliance Scores** (0-100 scale):
  - Mobility Score - Wheelchair/walker accessibility
  - Vision Score - Visual impairment accommodations
  - Hearing Score - Auditory assistance features
  - Cognition Score - Wayfinding and clarity
  - Total Score - Overall ADA compliance rating
- **Analysis ID** - Unique identifier linking all related data

### **2. Violation Markers** (`MARKERS` table)
- **Detection Details**: Type of violation, timestamp in video
- **AI Confidence**: How certain the AI is (0-100%)
- **Bounding Box Coordinates**: Exact location in frame
- **Context**: Description and notes about the issue
- Example markers:
  - "Missing handrail at 15.2 seconds, 92% confidence"
  - "Door width violation at 45.0 seconds, 85% confidence"

### **3. Recommendations** (`RECOMMENDATIONS` table)
- **Actionable Fixes**: Specific improvements needed
- **Impact/Effort Matrix**: High/Medium/Low ratings
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
  - Estimated remediation cost
  - Risk mitigation value (lawsuit prevention)
  - ROI percentage
- **ADA Policy References**: Specific codes (e.g., ADA 505.2)

## üìä How Data Flows to Snowflake

```
1. Video Analysis (AWS Rekognition)
       ‚Üì
2. Real-time Detection (Every 2-3 seconds)
       ‚Üì
3. Accessibility Issue Identification
       ‚Üì
4. Data Aggregation in Browser
       ‚Üì
5. "Save to Snowflake" Button (Manual)
       ‚Üì
6. API Call to /api/snowflake/analysis
       ‚Üì
7. Snowflake Cloud Storage
```

### **What Triggers Storage:**
- User clicks "Save to Snowflake" after 5+ issues detected
- Batch upload of all accumulated detections
- Includes video metadata + all markers + generated recommendations

## üí° How We Use the Data

### **1. Executive Dashboard**
Real-time metrics displayed:
- Total buildings analyzed
- Average compliance scores across portfolio
- Number of critical violations found
- High-priority fixes needed

### **2. Trend Analysis**
```sql
-- Example: Compliance trends over time
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', CREATED_AT) as WEEK,
       AVG(TOTAL) as AVG_COMPLIANCE
FROM ANALYSES
GROUP BY WEEK
ORDER BY WEEK;
```

### **3. Risk Assessment**
- **Critical Violations Alert**: Buildings with <70% compliance
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Which fixes provide best ROI
- **Pattern Recognition**: Common issues across properties

### **4. Compliance Reporting**
- Generate reports for:
  - Property managers
  - Legal teams
  - Insurance providers
  - Regulatory bodies
- Track improvements over time
- Document remediation efforts

## üéØ Business Value

### **Litigation Prevention**
- Average ADA lawsuit costs: **$50,000 - $250,000**
- Our data helps identify issues **BEFORE** complaints
- Documented compliance efforts reduce liability

### **Prioritized Remediation**
- **Quick Wins**: High-impact, low-cost fixes identified
- **ROI Calculations**: Every recommendation includes cost/benefit
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Data drives improvement priorities

### **Portfolio Management**
- Compare compliance across multiple properties
- Identify systemic issues needing policy changes
- Track contractor performance on remediation

---

## üîí Data Security & Privacy

- **No PII Stored**: Only building/location data
- **Encrypted Connections**: TLS for all data transfers
- **Role-Based Access**: Snowflake RBAC implementation
- **Audit Trail**: All queries and modifications logged

## üìà Sample Insights from Snowflake

### **Top 5 Most Common Violations**
1. Missing/inadequate handrails (342 instances)
2. Door width non-compliance (289 instances)
3. Insufficient lighting (245 instances)
4. Missing tactile indicators (198 instances)
5. Inaccessible counter heights (156 instances)

### **ROI Analysis Example**
```
Handrail Installation:
- Cost: $1,000 per stairway
- Risk Mitigation: $50,000 (potential lawsuit)
- ROI: 4,900%
- Priority: HIGH
```

### **Compliance Score Distribution**
- 15% of buildings: 85-100 (Excellent)
- 35% of buildings: 70-84 (Good)
- 30% of buildings: 55-69 (Needs Improvement)
- 20% of buildings: <55 (Critical)
